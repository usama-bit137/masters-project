# masters-project
## Purpose of this project: 
This is an investigation on the effects of minimally-coupled gravity on scalar interactions. It is an extention of my post-graduate work at Imperial College London.

We use python to develop a numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta to find the solution to the equation of motion of the scalar field coupled to the Ricci scalar of gravity. 

## Description of the problem

Suppose we have a massless scalar field $\phi$ in Minkowski spacetime with an associated potential $U(\phi)$. The action $S$ for such a system is simple and well documented by any astute learner of Quantum Field Theory as, 

$S = \int d^4x(\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2)$. 

If one chooses a radial, Lorentz-invariant coordinate
